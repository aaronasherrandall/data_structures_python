# Arrays: data sctructures

A collection of elements / values each identified by an array index or key.

- Index starts at zero
- Thanks to the indecies: random access is possible
  - We are able to access all and any element of the array

| Index  | Numbers[] |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0  | 34  |
| 1  | -12 |
| 2  | 2   |
| 3  | 300 |
| 4  | -45 |
| 5  |  0  |
| 6  | 5   |
| 7  |  1  |

```
numbers[4] = -45
```

## Multidimensional Arrays

Can prove to be very important in mathematical related computations ( matrices ):
