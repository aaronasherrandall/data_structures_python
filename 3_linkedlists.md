# Linked Lists 

Linked lists are composed of nodes and references / pointers which point from one node to the other.

The last node in a linked list always points to a null:

A single node:

- contains data -> integer, double or custom object
- contains a reference pointing to the next node in the linked list

The below is pseudo code illustrates a node below:
```
class Node {

  data
  Node nextNode
  ...
 }
 ```
 | Data | 
| ------------- | 
| Reference  |
