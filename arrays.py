## Python does not have a native array data sctucture
## However, it does have the list, which is much more general and can be used as a multidimensional array
## List in Python is an ordered collection of items which can be of any type

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# random indexing --> O(1) get items we know the index for
print(numbers[1])
